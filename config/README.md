## tsconfig.json files for each framework

The `tsconfig.json` files will be copied and pasted into the main `tsconfig.json` file in root folder.
In order to keep the frameworks consolidated into one package this work arround is done, since each framework (NextJS, GatsbyJS, React-Script) requires specific configuration.
